1. Using the pytorch SSD model from https://github.com/qfgaohao/pytorch-ssd. 
    1.1 Retrain it to Fruits-360 images from Kaggle.
    1.2 Retrain for blood cell detection
    1.3 How can it be extended to instance detection.
    1.4 Use instance detection in video images.
2. Faces
    2.1 Face detection
    2.2 Face recognition
3. Combine 1 & 2 to do in video person detection and then person identification.
4. Port this to Jetson Nano.
