# Amazon from sky

The amazon from sky kaggle data set is really a good example of real-world heterogeneity and noise in the labelling process. At first I had a quick glance at the kaggle page and ended up implementing a Resnet for multi-label classification. However this was as I found after a day of brute-force attempts not useful. I however discovered that the output of the network could not be thresholded with a constant and also needs to be optimized. Some on the kaggle kernel page had done it.
